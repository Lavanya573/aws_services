Problem Statement: Automating Daily Game Rewards Using AWS Services

The goal is to automate the distribution of daily rewards to active players in a game at a specific time each day, 
without manual intervention. 
This process will be triggered automatically using EventBridge Scheduler and orchestrated through AWS Step Functions, 
with the final execution handled by an AWS Lambda function.

1. EventBridge Scheduler will be used to trigger the event at 12:00 AM UTC+5:30 every day using a cron expression.
2. Step Functions will manage the flow of the event to ensure the reward distribution process is executed smoothly.
3. The Lambda function will simulate the process of sending rewards, such as updating a database or notifying players.
