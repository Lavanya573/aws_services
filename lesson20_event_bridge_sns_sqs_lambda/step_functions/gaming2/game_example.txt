Gaming Example 1 - EventBridge Scheduler to automatically schedule events.

1) Scheduling Daily Game Rewards

We want to send a daily reward to active players at a specific time, like 12:00 AM every day.
Instead of manually triggering the event, we'll use EventBridge Scheduler to schedule it automatically.

a) Create an EventBridge Scheduler Rule : DailyGameRewardsSchedule (Automatically send daily rewards to active players)

cron expression : cron(0 0 * * ? *) // schedule the event at 12:00 AM UTC+5:30 every day.

b) Create Lambda Function : SendGameReward

import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Simulating sending rewards
    print("Sending daily rewards to active players.")
    
    # Add your reward logic here (e.g., update a database with rewards)
    
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps('Daily rewards sent successfully')
    }


c) Target : SendGameReward
